- 👋 Hi, I’m @soniacasanova
- 👀 I’m interested in many subjects, from Art to Quantum physics which now I think may have something in common. I am a social butterfly, I enjoy meeting new people and getting to experience new cultures and costumes. Also, I appreciate spending time at home with the company of my cat.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything that it is possible and more✨
