- 👋 Hi, I’m @soniacasanova and I am a 28-year-old girl from Barcelona. I have a bachelor's in graphic design and experience in UI/UX design, I started being interested in the tech world, mostly with the process that takes to have a website out there on the internet.  
- 👀 I’m interested in many subjects, from Art to Quantum physics which now I think may have something in common. I am a social butterfly, I enjoy meeting new people and getting to experience new cultures and costumes. Also, I appreciate spending time at home with the company of my cat.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack Development. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything that it is possible and more✨ 
- 📫 How to reach me via email : soniacasanovar@gmail.com
