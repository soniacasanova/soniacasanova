- 👋 Hi, I’m @soniacasanova
- 👀 I’m interested in many subjects, from Art to Quantum physics which I personally think that they have something in common. I am a social butterfly, I enjoy meeting new people and getting to experience new cultures and costumes. Also, I apreciate to spend time at home with the company of my cat.
